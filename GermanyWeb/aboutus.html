		<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
		<h4>At Global Insight Germany, we come into work each and everyday with the goal of providing the most informative, interesting, and interactive tours in all of
		Germany at a reasonable and affordable price!</h4>
		<br>
		<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
		<p>To put it bluntly, we are Global Insight Germany, a tour company dedicated to servicing tourists all over
		Germany. We were founded in late 2019 by a group of ambitious college students in Berlin, Germany with
		the goal of providing the best tours in all of the country. We made it a mission to put the customer first
		in our business and, rather than just give the exact same tour over and over, we instead take the approach
		of handcrafting and taloring every single tour we give around the specific wants and interests of the customer. In fact, almost
		every image you'll see on our website has actually been taken by our customers on their tours. Over just our 
		first years, we have managed to grow exponentially, now having opened offices in Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, 
		Leipzig, and Nuremburg and currently planning offices in both Essen and Dortmund by next year. We also are
		in the works of discussing bringing our company to other European countries such as France and Poland in order
		to bring the Global Insight Germany experience abroad. Still don't believe we're the very best? Then, take a look at
		these glowing reviews from some of our beloved customers:</p>
		<br>
		<p><i>"I'm usually not one for tours, but a friend of ours said taking a tour with Global Insight Germany was an absolute
		must on our trip to Berlin. Needless to say, they were more than right! Our tour was the absolute highlight
		of my entire trip and I experienced Berlin in a way I never would've on any other old tour. If you're not
		experiencing Germany through Global Insight Germany, you're not experiencing it right!"</i></p>
		<p>-R. Williams</p>
		<p><i>"I went on a Global Insight Germany tour for my high school class trip to Germany. Normally, most high school students find tours boring, but
		this tour was completely different. Our tour guide was such a hilarous and chill guy and really tailored the experience to
		each one of our interests! It honestly felt like we all were just hanging out an exploring Germany with a college 
		kid. Everybody in our class loved the trip and our guide. 5 stars. 10/10. Global Insight Germany absolutely made our trip for us!"</i><p>
		<p>-A. White</p>
		<p><i>"We set up a tour of Munich through Global Insight Germany as part of our company's business trip to Munich. Most
		of us were just expecting it to be a regular old tour, but to our surpise it was so much more than that. Our
		guide was an absolute saint and we didn't want to stop hiking around Munich with her. In fact, it was so great
		that all of the people who didn't get to go are super jealous of everything we experienced! Couldn't recommend enough!"</p></i>
		<p>-O. Simpson</p>
		<br>
		<p>So, you've heard what our customers have had to say and you've heard what we've had to say. Now, we want to hear
		what YOU have to say! If you haven't already, head on over to our front page and sign up to become a member of the
		Global Insight Germany family, today! We'll be so happy to have you and you certainly won't regret it! We promise! Now, let's
		go experience Deutschland together!</p>
